A modified version of the [ACE-Java](https://bitbucket.org/marco-tiloca-sics/ace-java/) implementation for the [Publish-Subscribe](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ace-pubsub-profile/) profile.

This is a mavenized Java 1.8 project. You should be able to compile and run these classes by using Maven.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is a Java library for the functions necessary to run a client, resource server, and authorization server as specified in [RFC9200](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9200).
*  The library also implements the [DTLS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9202) and [OSCORE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9203) profiles.
*  The base libraries do not include network functionality, since they are supposed to be protocol agnostic. However we provide [CoAP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7252) client and server support as an example of a protocol specific adaptation based on [Californium](https://www.eclipse.org/californium).
* Since this is a Java library, it is not intended for resource constrained devices, rather it is intended to be used on the "other end", by the resource rich nodes talking to the resource constrained ones.

### Quick start ###

* For Eclipse, run the maven command "mvn eclipse:eclipse", and then import the project.
* Install a MySQL server.
* In the root directory, create a file 'db.pwd' of exactly two lines. The first line specifies the user name of a MySQL user that has database creation privileges. The second line specifies the password of such user.
* The test class files can now be run to check that everything is working correctly.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just clone the repo, do the Maven fu and you are good to go.
* Configuration: You need to set up a MySQL database to run the Junit tests. To run in production you need to configure everything, starting with your resource servers (out of scope here), the access control policies for the authorization server (KissPDP has a demo format backed in the database, check the test resources), the discovery of AS (out of scope again).
* Dependencies: Check the .pom file.
* Database configuration: first, set up a MySQL or Postgresql database. For running the Junit tests, create a file 'db.pwd' in the root directory of this library. The first line specifies the user name of a MySQL user that has database creation privileges. The second line specifies the password of such user. For example, if the user is "root" and its password is "root_pwd" (both without quotes), then the file 'db.pwd' looks as follows:
  ```
  root
  root_pwd
  ```
  If you want an alternative database you have to change the dependencies to 
  include another JDBC and double check if SQLConnector uses a compatible syntax.
* How to run tests: Run the Test* class files in the src/test folders. The CoAP tests will auto start a CoAP server (as normal program not as Junit test) first (you don't need to do anything). For all tests to work you also have to replace [JCE Unlimited Strength Policy](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html) files.
* Deployment instructions: You should be able to set up the code for testing by just using the maven pom.xml and configuring the database (as explained above).

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests: Yes please! I'd be happy to support you if you have ideas about which tests would be needed.
* Code review: Yes please! Please use the Issue tracker and/or Pull requests.
* Other guidelines: Follow the [Code Conventions for Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html), don't add new dependencies unless there is a really good reason.
